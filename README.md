# GRIP_Intern_Task2
This repository contains task 2 of "DATA SCIENCE & BUNIESS ANALYTICS INTERNSHIP" by Team GRIP@THE SPARKS FOUNDATION.
Task 2 - Prediction Using Unsupervised Machine Learning
Problem Statement
From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.
The "Iris.csv" file contains the dataset.
Approach ->"K-Means Clustering Algorithm"
IMPORTANT LIBRARIES
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
from sklearn import datasets
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
CONCLUSION
From the analysis & implementation of K-Means Clustering algorithm i can conclude that for the given Iris dataset "the optimum number of clusters is 3"
